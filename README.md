# SpotifyModel
Predictive model based on Spotify's API metrics. Goal is to explore if rating songs on a 1-4 scale can help distinguish between songs that a user loves (4) and likes (3), not just simple like and dislike. In the code provided, a test is done comparing good songs (3s and 4) to bad ones (1s and 2s). The other test is done to compare only 3s and 4s, which has very limited success.

## Built With
[Spotipy](https://github.com/plamere/spotipy) - Python package to interact with Spotify API
